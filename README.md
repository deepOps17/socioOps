A social media API developed using Python, FastAPI and PostgreSQL in which users can create an account, create posts and can view/like other user's posts. This app is deployed using Heroku, uses Pydantic for schema validation, uses OAuth2 with JWT to create access tokens and the user credentials are hashed using SHA256 algorithm. 

Features that are yet to be developed:
* Containerize the app using Docker
* Create an efficient CI/CD pipeline and develop unit test cases using Pytest
* Create an REST API automation framework using RestAssured and manage using Jenkins
